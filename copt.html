<h3>Combinatorial Optimization for Smart Power Grids</h3>	
  <p>Rapid penetration of renewable energy based Distributed Energy Resources (DER) has the potential to exacerbate the challenges inherent in grid frequency and voltage regulation. However, their real time controllability can be leveraged to not only mitigate such challenges, but improve the economics and quality of grid operations. </p>
<p>A plethora of scheduling algorithms have been developed for fast and efficient scheduling of these renewable energy based Distributed Energy Resources (DER). These algorithms schedule the complex - real and reactive power injected into (or drawn from) the grid by the DERs under various cost objective functions and grid constraints. However, a vast majority of such algorithms assume the feasible range of power injections to be continuous. In reality, the control options available for several DERs form a discrete space. This implies that the feasible range of power injections also forms a discrete space. This makes DER scheduling an NP-hard problem. Integer/Mixed Integer program based algorithms, which guarantee optimality in the objective value, have been developed. But these are prohibitively expensive in terms of computational time requirements. On the other hand, fast heuristic based solutions have also been developed. But as they do not provide any guarantee on the optimality of the objective, or on satisfying the constraints, they are unreliable for grid operations.
</p>

<p>The objective of this research is to develop polynomial runtime complexity approximation algorithms to perform cost optimal supply demand matching in smart grids targeting various objective functions and constraints such as cost minimization, fairness, network constraints etc. Using both theoretical analysis and practical evaluations, we show that our supply demand matching algorithms provide solutions which are close to optimal in a small amount of time.</p>
<p>Approximation Algorithm Techniques used: Dynamic Programming Rounding based FPTAS, Greedy Sub-modularity based algorithm, Linear Programming Rounding based Constant Factor Approximation Algorithm, Two-state stochastic optimization based approximation algorithm</p>
